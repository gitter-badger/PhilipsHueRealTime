PhilipsHueRealTime stays for real-time controller and application for Philips Hue LED Lighting

Developed by the Philips Hue Developer, who has tested tens of Philips Hue LED Lighting remote, wireless control applications run on smartphones.

PhilipsHueRealTime Technology is based on PROLOG'S Predicates, straight self-parsed commands or calls send to web server and on Fuzzy Logic GUI interface, supported by Location Based Services, Gyro, Accelerometer and 20 more sensors like GPS, TAWS to build 3D Philips Hue LED Lighting Control Interface.

Code overheads client-side and server-side can be cut by a factor of 100 (1:100)

So one simple PROLOG's sentence can act either as Hue API's call request and response.

No more JSON's multi-level tree structures to be parsed, generating computer time overheads and delays.
PhilipsHueRealTime Technology has been implemented into the World's First Smart City.People.Lighting Project, submitted to City.People.Lighting Challenge 2015 by Philips.
